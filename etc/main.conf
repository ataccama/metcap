# == METRICS CAPACITOR MAIN CONFIGURATION FILE ===
# (TOML syntax)
#

# Enable logging to Syslog
syslog = false

# [debug] enables debug logging
# can be also controlled from system by signals:
# - SIGUSR1: enable debug
# - SIGUSR2: disable debug
debug = true

# == TRANSPORT ==
#
# The glue between listeners and writer
[transport]
# [type] can be either of
# - channel: in-memory go channel; only for single-host deployment
# - redis: for single- and multi-host deployment
# - amqp: with RabbitMQ cluster for multi-host HA deployment
type = "channel"

# [buffer_size] specifies transport channel capacity of metrics
buffer_size = 500000

# == Redis Transport options ==
#
# [redis_url] can be local or remote socket. Example:
# - "unix:///var/tmp/redis.sock|0"
# - "tcp://192.168.1.1:6379|15"
#redis_url = "tcp://localhost:6379|0"
#
# Redis request timeout can be controlled by [redis_timeout]
#redis_timeout = 5
#
# [redis_wait] specifies how long should we wait for Metric retrieval from Redis
#redis_wait = 1
#
# [redis_retries] specifies how many times to retry the failed operation before giving an error
#redis_retries = 3
# Redis connection pool capacity is specified by [redis_connections]
#redis_connections = 100
#
# Name of the queue in Redis
#redis_queue = "default"
#

# == AMQP Transport options ==
#
# [amqp_url] specifies connection URI for RabbitMQ
amqp_url = "amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672/"
#
# [amqp_timeout] sets TCP connection timeout for AMQP
amqp_timeout = 5
#
# [amqp_tag] serves as data flow identifier
amqp_tag = "default"
#
# Number of [amqp_consumers]
amqp_workers = 2


# == LISTENERS ==
#
# A listener is defined by stating [listener.{name}] section.
# {name} can be any of [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Codec can be one of
# influx, graphite (json is in the works ;)). If you want
# to disable the listener simply leave out the configuration.
# Protocol can be only "tcp" at this moment
# - [port]: port to listen on
[listener]
# [listener.influx]
# port = 8001
# protocol = "tcp"
# codec = "influx"
[listener.graphite]
port = 8002
protocol = "tcp"
codec = "graphite"
mutator_file = "/etc/metrics-capacitor/graphite_mutator.conf"

# == WRITER ==
#
# Writer is ElasticSearch bulk indexing processor. Options:
# - [urls]:        Array of ES endpoint URLs. You need to specify only one,
#                  cluster is discovered automatically
# - [timeout]:     ES request timeout in seconds.
# - [concurrency]: How many concurrent processors to spawn.
# - [bulk_max]:    Maximum count of metrics in one bulk index request.
# - [bulk_wait]:   Maximum time before each bulk request is sent, regardless [bulk_max].
# - [index]:       Prefix for index name. Results in [index]-YYYY.MM.DD template.
# - [doc_type]:    Document type for raw data intake
